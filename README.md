=========
Looking for something to rewrite in your favourite MV* framework? Why not jQueryAir?

## What's this?
This sample jQuery app/form was written just to be rewritten in MV* framework. To train, to learn and to challenge your skills.

## The code
You'll find all you need in `index.html` and `js/main.js`. Code is easy to read and there isn't a lot of it (250~ lines of JavaScript and ~110 lines of HTML).
